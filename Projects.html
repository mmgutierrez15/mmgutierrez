                      the 2 front chainring version of Shimano GRX to have an <br>
                      ample range of gear ratios suitable for the Berkeley Hills. <br>
                      Decided on an older Aluminum frame for durability. <br>

                      reachability being determined by a site being 5 minutes <br>
